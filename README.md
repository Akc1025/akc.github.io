This accuont is a personal account that has been used to create and clone a repository.
The repository was created using a similar username with the github.io added in addtion to the title.
Once github desktop was downloaded to my desktop I opened the app and located the repository I created. I clicked on the file icon and selected clone repository and then selected the repository I created.This then created a new document file along with the README file.
